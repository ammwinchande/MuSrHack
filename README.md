# MuSrHack Font
Hack font with ligatures for awesome Editor Experience

Manually patched [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) font for all
[NerdFont](https://nerdfonts.com/) goodness.

Hack is available on the nerdFont website, but not the version with ligatures.
The ligatured version was provided by
[@vikky49](https://github.com/vikky49/patchedFonts-Ligatures)!
Using the ligature enabled version of Hack<br/><br/><br/>
